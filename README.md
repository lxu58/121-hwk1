CMPM121 Homework 1


1. What is your scene?

    I would call my scene "christmas tree with food", in the middle of the scene, there is tree in the middle
    of the scene and growing different types of food on it. In addition to this, there are apples on the ground
    and the tree is surrounded by the randomly generated bushes.

2. What kinds of objects did you include?
    I use the gameObjects I found on the assets shop, but I code my own generation function and movement controller
    to generate the bushes randomly and make the character move, there are few "empty" gameObject I made to use code
    to control the details about this scene, such as in setting object, there is a setting script controls the animation
    of all of these imported assets.

3. Did anything inspire you?
    newton's laws,  A Little Match Girl

4. What is the main character in this scene?
    The knife... The use of the knife I was thinking about is to hit the food on the tree, and those food will drop down,
    when the collision happened. I don't know if I can still use this scene for the next homework, but I do add the rb and
    hit box to the knife and all objects in case they might be needed for the next assignment.
